#  Movie Recommendation System

A **Movie Recommendation System** built with Machine Learning algorithms.  
This project predicts how likely a user is to enjoy a movie, based on the MovieLens 100K dataset.

---

##  Dataset
This project uses the [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), which contains:
- 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1,682 movies
- User demographic data (age, gender, occupation)
- Movie metadata (title, genre, release year)

> Dataset is included in the folder: `ml-100k/`

##  Features
 Build a recommendation model using **Collaborative Filtering**  
 Predict probabilities of liking a movie  
 Provide top-N recommendations for a user  
 Modular & ready for integration with web apps

-User-based Collaborative Filtering
-Item-based Collaborative Filtering
-(Coming soon: Matrix Factorization with SVD)
